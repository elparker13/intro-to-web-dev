    <h1> Oh My God </h1>
    <h3> By Adele </h3>
      <hr>
    <p>Oh my God, I can't believe it</p>
    <p>Out of all the people in the world</p>
    <p>What is the likelihood of jumping</p>
    <p>Out of my life and into your arms?</p>
    <p>Maybe, baby, I'm just losing my mind</p>
    <p>'Cause this is trouble, but it feels right</p>
    <p>Teetering on the edge of heaven and hell</p>
    <p>Is a battle that I cannot fight</p>
